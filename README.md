# Shopping Cart API with .NET 8, Aspire, gRPC, PostgreSQL, Marten, and Redis

This repository showcases a sample API built with .NET 8 that demonstrates the integration of .NET Aspire orchestration. The application utilizes Marten as its document database on PostgreSQL, and Redis for caching, all while leveraging gRPC for efficient communication. Together, these components provide a robust foundation for scalable web APIs.
